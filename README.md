Image Forensics Project: Tampering Localization & Source Camera Identification
This project integrates two essential computer vision techniques in digital forensics:

Tampering Localization: Detecting and segmenting manipulated regions in an image using a ConvNeXt-based segmentation model.

Source Camera Identification (SCI): Identifying the source camera of an image using PRNU (Photo-Response Non-Uniformity) patterns extracted via denoising (FFDNet) and classified using a ResNet model.
